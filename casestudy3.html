            <h3> Brief</h3>

            <p>USPS  designed an icon in the MegaMenu on USPS.com that would bring customers to the enhancements and new services made to for Small Businesses. Regardless of how good some of these services were the page was not getting a lot of traction and usage from customers. Booz Allen recognized the issues and decided to see how impactful the updated Small Business was for customers </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution">
            <h3> Solution</h3>

            <p>To understand why the Small Business Page was not gaining the traction it was expected to, the Booz Allen team interviewed customers to learn about how they navigate to the page, customer habits, and brand sentiment. The team then looked at the responses to draw out user insights, opportunities, and recommendations for how to improve the Small Business Page and draw attraction to the page and its services. The Booz Allen Team also designed a repeatable methodology, based on the interviews,  to understand today’s Small Business Page customers through the development of robust data-driven user personas. Personas are a key component to understanding and then developing an effective User Experience (UX) that greatly improves brand awareness and successful transactions 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="impact">
            <h3> Impact</h3>

            <p>From the user interviews that were conducted, the Booz Allen team collaborated to identify relevant data points that were used to develop the Small Business Page personas, resulting in a newfound understanding of the Small Business Page and broader USPS.com customer.
            </p>

            <p>Their research strategy has been incorporated in the USPS Customer Experience Continuous Improvement approach and adopts a Research Repository to remove the silos that exist when research is collected and stored separately. Researchers will now be able to efficiently access and compare research data from historical and new research studies. The database will allow the Booz Allen team to provide USPS partners with easy and fast background information on users, even if they don’t have access to vetted user research internally. The methodology of collecting and using existing data can be repeated every year greatly increasing the Postal Store’s success in capitalizing on changing consumer trends.</p>
