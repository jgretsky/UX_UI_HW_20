            <h3> Brief</h3>

            <p>The Parent Association supports the school by volunteering and by raising funds  to provide the resources to enhance educational opportunities at the school. They strive to promote a strong sense of community at Stuyvesant High School. Every parent and guardian at the school is a member of our Parentsâ€™ Association. 
            </p>

            <p>The chairs of the parent association felt that the site was unorganized, outdated, and not being well utilized. The PA decided to ask for help to modernize and better organize their site.  The columbia university certificate team, made up of Julia, Alex, Claire, adn Dina, conducted research to better understand Stuy parent's needs and expectations. the group also conducted heuristic evaluations and card sorting to examine the usability of the site and its information architecture. All the prep work helped the team to redesign a site that was then tested and changed based upon further user feedback.
